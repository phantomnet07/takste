# Instagram Direct Message - Private 2-Person Chat

A private, minimalist 2-person messaging website styled 1:1 after **Instagram Direct Messages** with real-time synchronization, voice notes, photo sharing, profile pictures with permanent server sync, user custom stickers, message replies, long-press actions, hover actions, swipe gestures, and server-side chat history.

---

## 🌟 Key Features & Updates

1. **Profile Picture Upload with Server Sync (Permanent)**:
   - **user1** can upload & change his own profile picture from the Details modal (`ⓘ`). Only user1 can edit it.
   - **user2** can upload & change her own profile picture from the Details modal (`ⓘ`). Only user2 can edit it.
   - When user1 changes his picture, user2's chat header, incoming message avatars, and typing indicators update in real-time.
   - When user2 changes her picture, user1's chat header, incoming message avatars, and typing indicators update in real-time.
   - Avatars are stored permanently in `./data/avatars/` and cached locally across device restarts.

2. **Android Emojis & Reaction System**:
   - Tapping `+` on the reaction menu opens the full **Instagram / Android Reaction Sheet**.
   - Reacting with an emoji **applies the reaction directly to that message** without putting text in the message box.
   - Emojis are grouped in one continuous vertically-scrolling section with quick category jump tabs (`😀`, `👋`, `❤️`, `🐶`, `🍏`, `⚽`, `🚗`, `💯`).
   - On **Mobile (Phone)**: Users type messages using their native Gboard/system keyboard; website emoji grid is hidden from message input so it doesn't clutter the screen, while the reaction sheet is styled 1:1 with Instagram mobile.
   - On **Desktop (PC)**: Chat input includes the emoji button to type emojis into the message box, and hovering over messages shows hover action pills.

3. **Hover Action Controls (Desktop/PC) & Long-Press (Mobile)**:
   - On PC / Desktop, hovering over any message reveals 3 action buttons:
     - `☺` **React**: Opens the emoji reaction pill (`❤️ 😂 😮 😢 😡 👍 ➕`).
     - `⤺` **Reply**: Activates reply mode with quoted preview snippet.
     - `⋮` **More Options**: Opens the full action card (Edit, Copy, Unsend, Delete for me).
   - On mobile, long-pressing any bubble triggers the exact same actions!

4. **Section Time Dividers (Instagram Style)**:
   - Center headers (e.g. `Thu 10:59 PM`, `Yesterday 8:02 PM`) automatically divide conversation clusters whenever a time gap occurs.

5. **Accurate "Seen" Status**:
   - Outgoing messages display real-time seen status below the last sent message (`Seen just now`, `Seen 2m ago`, `Seen Yesterday at 10:59 PM`).

6. **Private Credentials (Per Admin Security)**:
   - Each admin can **ONLY** view and edit their **OWN** credentials.
   - Passcodes default to: Admin 1 = `user1`, Admin 2 = `user2`.

7. **Photo Modes (View Once, Replay, Keep in Chat)**:
   - 💣 **View once**: Disappears after 1 view.
   - 🔄 **Allow replay**: Up to 2 views before expiring.
   - ♾️ **Keep in chat**: Permanent photo with full lightbox and Download button.
